# Math360_Project1
Midterm assignment for my class Math 360: Model Building in Applied Math.

The papers directory includes the final draft itself -` math360_project1_Rahman.pdf` - along with the images that show up in the final draft, tables, and the LaTeX file that produces the pdf. 

`master.bat` will reproduce the entire process of generating the document exactly the way I did it. The main purpose of this file is to aid in replication and help potential team members understand the workflow of the project. 


`charts.py` is where most of the code is. That covers problems 2 to 6. This file generates the tables, charts, and does any calculations that are needed in the paper. 
`problem7.py` is for problem 7. That problem warranted it's own seperate script just because it involved pretty significant changes to the model. `maybe_investigate_later.py` is mainly for scratch work. It has some ideas that didn't make it to the final version of the script but I might still want to play around with the code in future projects.
