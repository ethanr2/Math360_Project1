# Math360_Project1
Midterm essay for my class Math 360: Model Building in Applied Math.

The paper itself is papers/project1.pdf along with the images that show up in the final draft, tables, and the Tex file that produces the pdf. 

charts.py is where most of the code is. That covers problems 2 to 6. This file generates the tables, charts, and does any calculations that are needed in the paper. 
problem7.py is for problem 7. That problem warranted it's own seperate script just because it involved pretty significant changes to the model.
